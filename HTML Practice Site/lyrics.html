    [Part I: House of Balloons]

    [Intro]
    Woah, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    Uh
    Uh huh
    Yeah-eah

    [Verse 1]
    Been on a further level since you came, no more pain
    You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face
    You're in my world now, you can stay, you can stay
    But you belong to me, ooh, you belong to me

    [Pre-Chorus]
    If it hurts to breathe, open a window (Woo-ooh)
    Oh, your mind wants to leave (Yeah), but you can't go, oh

    [Chorus]
    This is a happy house (A happy house)
    We're happy here (We're happy here)
    In a happy house
    Oh, this is fun, fun, fun, fun
    Fun, fun, fun, fun
    Fun, fun, fun, fun
    Woah
    Woah, Woah-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
    
    [Verse 2]
    Music got you lo-o-ost
    Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
    Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
    This place will burn you u-u-up
    Baby, it's okay, them my niggas next door
    And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
    So blame it on me that you didn't call you home
    Oh, just don't blame it on me girl, 'cause you wanted to have fun

    [Pre-Chorus]
    If it hurts (Woo, woo) to breathe, open a window (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
    Oh, your mind wants to leave, but you can't go (Ooh)

    [Chorus]
    This is a happy house
    We're happy here in a happy house
    Oh, this is fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun)
    Fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun to me)
    Fun, fun, fun, fun
    Woah (Woah)
    Woah, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

    [Part II: Glass Table Girls]

    [Segue]
    Bring the 707 out
    Bring the 707 out
    Bring the 707 out
    Bring the 707 out
    Bring the 707 out
    Bring the 7


    [Verse]
    Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
    Whatever, together
    Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
    Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
    Then watch us chase it
    With a handful of pills, no chasers
    Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
    She bad and her head bad
    Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
    And it's half-past six
    Read skies 'cause time don't exist
    But when the stars shine back to the crib
    Superstar lines back at the crib
    And we can test out the tables
    We got some brand new tables
    All glass and it's four feet wide
    But it's a must to get us ten feet high
    She give me sex in a handbag
    I get her wetter than a wet nap
    And no closed doors
    So I listen to her moans echo
    "I heard he do drugs now"
    You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
    We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
    And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
    Yeah, I'm always on that okey-dokey
    Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
    Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
    Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
    "Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
    "She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
    I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
    Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
    Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
    If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
    But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
    And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street


    [Outro]
    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
    I'm so gone, so gone
    Bring out the glass tables (Ooh, ooh)
    Bring the 707 out
    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
    I'm so gone, so gone
    Bring out the glass tables (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) (Ooh, ooh)
    The 707 out
    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
    I'm so gone, so gone
    Bring out the glass tables (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la) (Ooh, ooh)
    Put the 707 out
    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
    I'm so gone, so gone
    Bring out the glass tables
    Put the 707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
    707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
    707 out (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
    Oh (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
    (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
